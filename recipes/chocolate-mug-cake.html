    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you Google "mug cake," you'll get more than 100 million results for the one-serving cake that's abked in a mug in the microwave.
        Yet finding the right recipe - not too dense, not too sweet - is harder than one might hope.
        This version, adapted from "Baking Class: 50 Fun Recipes Kids Will Love to Bake!" by Deanna F. Cook, is great, and requires just a few
        pantry staples. For a molten chocolate mug cake, sprinkle the top with some mini chocolate chips before popping it into the
        microwave, then remove it a few seconds early. This cute little cake may have been developed for children, but everyone loves it.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>A few drops vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 to 4 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>A pinch of kosher salt</li>
        <li>Confectioners' sugar or vanilla ice cream (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Microwave the butter in a microwave-safe mug in 10-second increments until melted, 20 to 30 seconds.
            Crack the egg into a small bowl; add the vanilla and whisk to combine using a small whisk or fork.
            Pour the egg mixture into the mug over the butter and whisk to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add the sugar, cocoa powder and salt and whisk until mostly smooth (a few lumps are OK).
            Scrape down the sides the best you can with a spoon or a small silicone spatula.
        Sprinkle with mini chocolate chips, if desired.</li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave on high for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean.
            Sift a little confectioners' sugar on top or serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired. Dig in with a spoon.
        </li>
    </ol>
