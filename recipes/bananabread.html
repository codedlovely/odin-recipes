    <h1>Chocolate-chip Banana Bread</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe uses four bananas, which is more than is typical for a single loaf. The natural sugars from the ripe, brown bananas keep the bread incredibly moist for up to one week, even sliced.
        The high moisture of the batter can make it tricky to determine doneness, so take care not to underbake the loaf.
        It should have a dry, shiny, cracked surface, and a tester inserted into the thickest portion should come out with a few moist crumbs attached.
        Serve this banana bread for breakfast of brunch, or even as a simple dessert, topped with a scoop of coffee ice cream.

    <p>I tried this recipe personally and it was amazing.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick spray</li>
        <li>4 ripe bananas, peeled</li>
        <li>85g unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>80ml greek yogurt</li>
        <li>220g brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>255g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>135g mini chocolate chips</li>
        <li>130g walnuts (chopped and toasted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Lightly grease 23-by-13-cm loaf pan with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mash the bananas coarsely using a fork or potato masher. Whisk in the melted butter, yogurt, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda and salt to combine. Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir to combine using a silicone spatula or wooden spoon. Scrape the sides and base of the bowl well to make sure the mixture is uniformly combined.</li>
        <li>Gently stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts until combined, then pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the edges of the loaf start to pull away from the edge of the pan, and a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 60 to 75 minutes. If the top of the loaf is becoming too dark before it's baked through, loosely cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Transfer from the oven to a cooling rack and run a thin knife around the edge of the banana bread to separate it from the pan. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before unmolding and cooling completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tip</h3>
    <p>To make chocolate chocolate-chip banana bread, reduce the all-purpose flour to 225g, and whisk in 30g cocoa powder with the other dry ingredients in Step 3.</p>
